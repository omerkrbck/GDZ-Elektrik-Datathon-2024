# GDZ-Elektrik-Datathon-2024
CODERSPACE ¬∑ COMMUNITY PREDICTION COMPETITION    GDZ Elektrik Datathon 2024 - Final:

"Maintaining the continuity and quality of energy is among the basic duties of electricity distribution companies. While power outages are sometimes planned, sometimes they occur unplanned and unexpected. Against unplanned outages, electricity distribution companies try to ensure energy continuity by minimizing the downtime with fast and effective interventions. To ensure this continuity, special rule-based work order software is generally used in the field.

As data scientists, we are expected to predict the number of unplanned outages going forward in the regions served by GDZ. In the district breakdown, daily unplanned outage numbers, meteorological data and data on special days are provided.

üõ°Ô∏è We want you to estimate the number of daily unplanned outages based on district!"
